# SaaS Metrics Aplication

Hello! Welcome to my SaaS Metrics project. In this repo I will be modeling, developing and deploying an open-source application that will transform data and present it through a web application.
The idea for this project is to improve my skill as a full-stack developer and as a data scientist.

## Goals

As I said the main idea here is to improve my skills with a real-life project. Nonetheless, I will also aim to achieve the following goals:

1. Architectural Goal -> Model a simple yet reliable database that will receive transactional data about products acquistion and payment.
2. Visualization Goal -> Create a beautiful and meaningful dashboard with essential SaaS Metrics
3. Code Goal -> Develop a clean code following Python's best practices.

## Tech-Stack (This might change in future versions)

- Python (Main Programming Language)
- Dash (Data Visualization)
- Flask (Application Framework)
- AWS Redshift (Cloud Data Warehouse)

## Contribution

My progress will be documented through the Projects and Wiki sections of this repo. If you notice anything odd (codewise or a spelling mistake), have any suggestion or just want to talk feel free to open an issue :) As I said my goal here is to improve and any tips are welcome!
